# Weather-App-JavaScript-OpenWeather-API-HTML-CSS-

Project Overview:
Developed a fully functional weather forecasting web application that allows users to search for real-time weather data based on city names. The app fetches weather details from the OpenWeather API and displays dynamic information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions (rain, clouds, clear sky, etc.). It also incorporates intuitive error handling for invalid city inputs.

Key Features:
City Search Functionality: Users can input a city name to retrieve real-time weather data.
Dynamic Weather Display: Information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather condition icons (clouds, rain, etc.) are updated dynamically based on API responses.
Error Handling: Displays an error message if the city name is not found or an API error occurs.
Responsive Design: Ensures the app is accessible and easy to use on various screen sizes (desktop and mobile).
Interactive UI: The app provides an interactive experience with clear feedback to the user, including weather icons and dynamic data updates.

Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
API Integration: OpenWeather API (for fetching weather data)
Version Control: Git, GitHub

Skills Demonstrated:
API Integration and handling asynchronous requests using Fetch API.
DOM manipulation to dynamically update content based on the API response.
Responsive design to ensure cross-device compatibility.
Error handling and user input validation.
